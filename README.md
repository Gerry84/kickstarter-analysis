## Overview of Project
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Analysis and Challenges
Performed an analysis on the parent category theaters by breaking the outcomes into "succesfull", "failed", and "canceled" and analyzing the data per month.
The outcomes are predomenantly successful with some failed and little canceld. The main challenge was to format the pivot table.

A further analysis was done on Outcomes Based on Goals in the subcategory "plays". The data shows mixed results for successful and failed launches and there haven't been any canceled launches in this category. A challenge was to create formulas without using hardcoded information.
