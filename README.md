## Overview of Project
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Analysis and Challenges
Performed an analysis on the parent category theaters by breaking the outcomes into "succesfull", "failed", and "canceled" and analyzing the data per month.
The outcomes are predomenantly successful with some failed and little canceld. The main challenge was to format the pivot table.

A further analysis was done on Outcomes Based on Goals in the subcategory "plays". The data shows mixed results for successful and failed launches and there haven't been any canceled launches in this category. A challenge was to create formulas without using hardcoded information.

## Results
* What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date?<br>
  First conculsion is that launches have been predominately successful<br>
  There have been very little cancelation<br>
* What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?<br>
  There have been no cancelations<br>
* What are some limitations of this dataset?<br>
  We cannot see when the launch was canceled<br>
  Results are provided in different currencies<br>
* What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?<br>
  Graph and tables of different subcategories<br>
  Analysis on which categories got canceled or failed the most<br>
